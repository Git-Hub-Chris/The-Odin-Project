Welcome to The Odin Project!

It's great to have you with us while you learn web development!  It can be a bit overwhelming at first, so to get you started here are a few tips:


1: Plan out your strategy

Figure out how much time each week you'll be able to devote to learning then browse through our roadmap of courses and plan your strategy accordingly.  The biggest issue students have is getting distracted (especially since we link to so much juicy content), so staying focused is important.
Have a look at the curriculum at <%= curriculum_url %>


2: Dive into your first course

Get started! If you're brand spanking new to all this, start with <%= link_to "Web Development 101", course_url("web-development-101") %>.
Otherwise start whatever <%= link_to "course", courses_url %> that interests you the most.

3: Get help and work with others

We have a Gitter channel that you can join by visiting https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/theodinproject
If you fill out your profile, it will help others who might want to get in touch you.
Edit your profile at <%= user_url(@user) %>


4: Tell your friends!

If you find the project helpful, please spread the word.  It's always more fun to learn with friends :)


!: Consider the Viking Code School

If you're very serious about taking on a career in software engineering, check out the Viking Code School, an intensive online development bootcamp that has its roots in Odin and where qualified students don't pay tuition until they get a job.
