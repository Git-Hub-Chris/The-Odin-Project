          <h3>Web Development 101</h3>

          <p>This is a free weekly study group on Sundays at 6pm. We will be working through The Odin Project <%= link_to "curriculum", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses" %> from beginning to end.</p>
  
          <p>During the week, we will be working through the curriculum 
          independently, and completed projects are due on Sunday at our meeting. During our study group meetings, we can show our completed projects, discuss questions, and keep each other motivated.</p>
  
          <p>Parts of the curriculum will appear to be review for some people. Parts of the curriculum will appear to be insurmountable for some people. We will steadily progress, nonetheless.</p>

          <p>
            It's a tough week this week so I hope you've gotten a head start -- we'll be doing all the lessons up to the Jumpstart Blogger tutorial in Ruby on Rails. For some, it may be your first taste of Rails.  It'll be challenging at first because I'm intentionally throwing a lot at you.  We can debug your issues in the study group.

            Because we didn't have a real meeting last week, consider this a reprieve and some extra time to work on Ruby!  The homework assignment is still chapters 1 - 10 in Chris Pine's book but you can hopefully also dive into the Ruby Monk lessons listed in the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-basics">Ruby Basics</a> lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Sunday we will review any questions you have about Chris Pine's book, the Ruby Monk tutorials, and look ahead to the Test-first project which will be done the following week.

            starting at the <%= link_to "Ruby on Rails section", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons" %>.
            We'll meet online weekly, go over our efforts, and help answer each others questions.</p>

            <strong><p>Your fearless guide: <a href="https://github.com/afshinator">Afshin</a></p></strong>
  
           <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
           <ul>
             <li>Be comfortable with Git, HTML, CSS, javascript, and especially Ruby code.  If you're not, 
             then you'll want to go through 
               <%= link_to "Web Dev 101 ", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons" %>
               and <%= link_to "Ruby ", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons" %>
               sections.
             </li>
             <li>Read and finish the   
               <%= link_to "course intro", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work" %>.
             </li>
           </ul>
            
          <p>Compared to a lot of other Rails tutorials, the Odin Rails curriculum covers a wider range of topics 
            - for good reason.  We want to be able to implement our own app ideas, not just follow a cookie-cutter
            recipe.  
           </p>
           
           <h4>Study-group Goals</h4>
           <ul>
             <li>Meet at least weekly to discuss efforts, problems, and their solutions,</li>
             <li>Provide a light at the end of the tunnel!  A schedule to keep to,</li>
             <li>Keep schedule flexible based on participants needs,</li>
             <li>Provide extra value by providing info form outside the curriculum,</li>
             <li>Comradery, and inspiration from fellow devs on the same track,</li>
             <li>and more!</li>
           </ul>
             
          <h4>Schedule</h4>
           <p>Will be posted after I get a better sense of how fast we're moving.</p>

          <p>Basic routing is pretty straightforward and in the routing section of the Odin
            curriculum we get a great explanation of a lot of what we need to know about the subject.
            I found turning to the RailsGuides for more detail to be a bad
            learning experience!  The main thrust of the week 5 hangout will be to cover some 
            details about routing not in the curriculum and poorly covered in the RailsGuides.

          <p>This next week will be the last time we'll work on material not specific to Rails.  
            Hopefully you took the opportunity this last week to explore RSpec outside the context of Rails and 
            gained familiarity with some of those <a href="http://betterspecs.org/" target="_blank">best practices</a>.              
          </p>
          <p>We'll review our re-writes of some of the Test-first-Ruby tests, the ruby implmentations
            for the tests, and the other assignments including touching on the article and gem.
            I'll present some material I consider pretty crucial with regards to testing that is not
            in Hartl or some of the other common resources.  Time permitting, there will be other 
            little knick-knacks!  Bring your questions!

            <strong>This first meeting will be mostly a meet-and-greet, and orientation.</strong>
            Some of us have already built some stuff with Rails, some of us don't yet know the difference 
            between Rails and Ruby; I expect a variety of levels.  Come one, come all.
          </p>
          <p>
            This first week lets go through an exploration of our installation and
            dev environment options, some talk around what we'd all like to get out of the course,
            what kind of time and effort we're willing and able to put into it, and anything else folks
            want to cover.

          <h3>Web Development 101</h3>

          <p>This is a free weekly study group on Sundays at 6pm. We will be working through The Odin Project <%= link_to "curriculum", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses" %> from beginning to end.</p>
  
          <p>During the week, we will be working through the curriculum 
          independently, and completed projects are due on Sunday at our meeting. During our study group meetings, we can show our completed projects, discuss questions, and keep each other motivated.</p>
  
          <p>I'm a beginner. But if you have more experience please feel free to join up. We are going to try and follow the same schedule as the previous Web development 101. I decided to start a study group so I can keep myself on schedule and for those have just started and feel to far behind to jump in the other groups.</p>
          <p> Note: I moved the first meeting to Tuesday 04/20/2014  at 6 pm CST since I realized that Sunday was Easter. It will just be a quick hello and introductions. We will them meet every Sunday at 6pm CST on 04/27/2014. In the calender I did try to make it so we can all edit and take a look. That way we can just add a hangout if you need help and someone can jump on and helpout. </p>

            It's a tough week this week so I hope you've gotten a head start -- we'll be doing all the lessons up to the Jumpstart Blogger tutorial in Ruby on Rails. For some, it may be your first taste of Rails.  It'll be challenging at first because I'm intentionally throwing a lot at you.  We can debug your issues in the study group.

            Because we didn't have a real meeting last week, consider this a reprieve and some extra time to work on Ruby!  The homework assignment is still chapters 1 - 10 in Chris Pine's book but you can hopefully also dive into the Ruby Monk lessons listed in the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-basics">Ruby Basics</a> lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Sunday we will review any questions you have about Chris Pine's book, the Ruby Monk tutorials, and look ahead to the Test-first project which will be done the following week.

          <h4>Week 2</h4>
          <p>If you missed last week's meeting and are still interested in climbing aboard, now is the time! Everyone was still getting up to speed at last week's study group, so we extended the first project through this week.</p>
  
          <p>For many, this looks like review. But it's trickier than it looks and takes longer than you might expect, so start early and work every day.</p>

          <p><strong>Note: </strong>There are 10 spots available in the interactive chat. We will be cycling participants in and out of the interactive chat to go over the project and questions. If you can't get into the interactive chat because it's full, you can watch the study group live, until a spot opens up for you.</p>  
  
          <p>Please wear headphones to avoid crazy echo madness.</p>
  
          <p>If you try to enter the interactive chat and get a Google server error, copy the link to the chat to your clipboard, log out of Google, paste the url into your browser and go to it, Google will ask for your password, then it should let you in.</p>

          <h3>Starting Your Own</h3>
  
          <p>
            These study groups are pretty ad-hoc -- they are run by students.  If you'd like to start one, you're welcome to cover any material you want at any pace you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, you could set up a daily Ruby study group that covers any questions people have about Ruby or you could have a weekly group that marches through the Javascript course at your own pace.
          </p>

          <h3>How it works</h3>

          <p>
            Each study group has its own tab on this /studygroups page (as you can see) and each of these tabs is maintained by the leader of that study group. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you want to lead a study group, just fork this project and create your own tab, then submit it as a pull request to the `dev` branch of the main repo.  It's the same flow (though less intense) that we describe in the <%= link_to "Contributing section", contributing_path %>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should be able to cut and paste code from the other tabs.  This is currently just one giant HTML file.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Disclaimer: This isn't the best way to do things, but we're still figuring out what we'll need to actually build in the future :)

          <h3>Leading a Study Group FAQ</h3>
            
          <ul>
            <li><strong>
              Why do people start these groups?
            </strong></li>
            <li>
              So far, the biggest reason has been so the leader can motivate him/herself to go through the material.  A nice side benefit is having other people to bounce questions off of.
            </li>
            <li><strong>
              What topics should I cover?
            </strong></li>
            <li>
              Anything you want! You could start in the middle, at the beginning, in the projects... if it's useful material to you, then it'll probably be useful for someone else too.
            </li>
            <li><strong>
              How often should we meet?
            </strong></li>
            <li>
              As often as you want.  Weekly seems to be good based on the groups so far.
            </li>
            <li><strong>
              How much code do I need to know?
            </strong></li>
            <li>
              Not much.  As an organizer, you just need to be able to edit this HTML page to keep your group schedule current from week-to-week.  As for the material itself that you'll be covering, you could already know it and offer to help people who don't or you could be learning it yourself at the same time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>
              How long do I need to lead the group?
            </strong></li>
            <li>
              As long as you want, though please give your students notice if you'll be discontinuing it (and remove its tab from this page).
            </li>
            <li><strong>How do I set up the video hangout?</strong></li>
            <ol>
              <li>Join our <%= link_to "Google Group", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/100013596437379837846" %>, where we keep up with the development of this whole project.</li>
              <li>Set up a <%= link_to "Google Hangout on Air", "https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair" %> and invite our google group ("Team Odin").  When you create the Hangout on Air, it will also create a Google Event for whenever you've scheduled the Hangout on Air</li>
              <li>Include the link to that Event in your study group tab (see the examples on other tabs, which have a link to each week's session)</li>
              <li>When it's time, "start" the Hangout on Air from the Event page.  It will take you to the Hangout window.  If you're in the Chrome browser (not Safari), you'll see an address bar at the top with the link to that Hangout.  Copy and paste that link into the Google Event page comments so everyone else in your group can join you.  Sometimes people may need to log out then try to follow the link (I don't know why).</li>
              <li>When you're ready to get started, click the "Start Broadcast" button from within the Hangout to begin broadcasting.  It will save the whole thing to your YouTube account when you're done.</li>
              <li>Cover your material, assign homework, and update your tab with the next week's links/assignments.  You can save time by scheduling events and Hangouts weeks in advance.</li>
            </ol>
