  <h3>Web Development 101</h3>

  <p>This is a free weekly study group on Sundays at 6pm. We will be working through The Odin Project <%= link_to "curriculum", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses" %> from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>During the week, we will be working through the curriculum 
  independently, and completed projects are due on Sunday at our meeting. During our study group meetings, we can show our completed projects, discuss questions, and keep each other motivated.</p>

  <p>I'm a beginner. But if you have more experience please feel free to join up. We are going to try and follow the same schedule as the previous Web development 101. I decided to start a study group so I can keep myself on schedule and for those have just started and feel to far behind to jump in the other groups.</p>
  <p> Note: I moved the first meeting to Tuesday 04/22/2014  at 6 pm CST since I realized that Sunday was Easter. It will just be a quick hello and introductions. We will them meet every Sunday at 6pm CST on 04/27/2014. In the calender I did try to make it so we can all edit and take a look. That way we can just add a hangout if you need help and someone can jump on and helpout. </p>

  <h4>What We'll Cover</h4>
  <p>
    It's a tough week this week so I hope you've gotten a head start -- we'll be doing all the lessons up to the Jumpstart Blogger tutorial in Ruby on Rails. For some, it may be your first taste of Rails.  It'll be challenging at first because I'm intentionally throwing a lot at you.  We can debug your issues in the study group.

  <h4>What We'll Cover</h4>
  <p>
    March 17 - March 23, 2014
  </p>
  <p>
    Because we didn't have a real meeting last week, consider this a reprieve and some extra time to work on Ruby!  The homework assignment is still chapters 1 - 10 in Chris Pine's book but you can hopefully also dive into the Ruby Monk lessons listed in the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-basics">Ruby Basics</a> lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Sunday we will review any questions you have about Chris Pine's book, the Ruby Monk tutorials, and look ahead to the Test-first project which will be done the following week.

  <h4>Week 2</h4>
  <p>If you missed last week's meeting and are still interested in climbing aboard, now is the time! Everyone was still getting up to speed at last week's study group, so we extended the first project through this week.</p>

  <p>For many, this looks like review. But it's trickier than it looks and takes longer than you might expect, so start early and work every day.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: </strong>There are 10 spots available in the interactive chat. We will be cycling participants in and out of the interactive chat to go over the project and questions. If you can't get into the interactive chat because it's full, you can watch the study group live, until a spot opens up for you.</p>  

  <p>Please wear headphones to avoid crazy echo madness.</p>

  <p>If you try to enter the interactive chat and get a Google server error, copy the link to the chat to your clipboard, log out of Google, paste the url into your browser and go to it, Google will ask for your password, then it should let you in.</p>

  <p>If that doesn't work, try the same steps in another browser.</p>
