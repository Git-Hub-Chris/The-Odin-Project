  <h3>The Ruby Track</h3>

  <p>This is a free weekly study group on TBD at a TBD time. We will be working through The Odin Project <%= link_to "curriculum", "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses" %> from beginning to end.</p>

  <p>During the week, we will be working through the curriculum 
  independently, and completed projects are due on the TBD date of our meeting. During our study group meetings, we can show our completed projects, discuss questions, and keep each other motivated.</p>

  <p>I'm a Ruby Newbie. But if you have more experience please feel free to join up. The final schedule will be posted shortly and will be a simple structure and will most likely be completed within 10 weeks. I have completed several tutorials in Rails (Framework for Ruby), but I am looking to increase my increase my experience with the Ruby Lang and looking for anyone else who is interested learning Ruby with me.</p>

  <p> Note: No time has been set as of yet but I created a poll to vote for our meeting time. There has been interest to pick a European friendly time, but prior to chosing a time, I want to get a feel for how many people would like to join and what time. </p>
