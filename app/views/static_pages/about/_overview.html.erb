          <h3 class="overview-card__heading">Origin of The Odin Project</h3>
          <p class="overview-card__content">The Odin Project was founded in 2013 by Erik Trautman. Erik was working for an intensive coding bootcamp at the time and had previously gone through the bootcamp himself. He quickly discovered that a lot of applicants were unable to enroll on the bootcamp, either due to financial or geographic constraints.</p>
          <p class="overview-card__content">This inspired Erik to create The Odin Project, a free open source curriculum that could be taken entirely online. Like a bootcamp it would lay out a path for students to follow to go from zero knowledge to proficent as a web developer. Since The Odin Projects inception it has helped many students get hired as a developer. And has helped countless others learn enough programming to work on their own personal projects.</p>
          <p class="overview-card__content">Erik has since moved on to found <a href='http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/'>The Viking Code School</a>. A for profit online intensive coding bootcamp, where he continues to teach students all they need to know to get hired as a web developer. The Odin Project lives on, being maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteer maintainers who carry on Eriks original vision.</p>

          <p class="overview-card__content">This website and the curriculum it hosts are completely open source. That means anyone can work on new features or fix existing bugs on the website. This also extends to the curriculum itself, anyone can work on new lessons, add new resources and improve existing lessons.</p>
          <p class="overview-card__content">The Odin project would not be possible without the hard work of contributors from all across the world. If you're interested in helping us make Odin better please find out <a href="<%= contributing_path %>">how to contribute.</a></p>
